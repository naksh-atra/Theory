        "To Jupyter users: Magics are specific to and provided by the IPython kernel. Whether Magics are available on a kernel is a decision that is made by the kernel developer on a per-kernel basis. To work properly, Magics must use a syntax element which is not valid in the underlying language. For example, the IPython kernel uses the % syntax element for Magics as % is not a valid unary operator in Python. However, % might have meaning in other languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is the help auto-generated from the docstrings of all the available Magics functions that IPython ships with.\n",

        "Then, typing ‘alias_name params’ will execute the system command ‘cmd params’ (from your underlying operating system).\n",
        "\n",
        "Aliases have lower precedence than magic functions and Python normal variables, so if ‘foo’ is both a Python variable and an alias, the alias can not be executed until ‘del foo’ removes the Python variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can use the %l specifier in an alias definition to represent the whole line when the alias is called. For example:\n",

For details of the semantic rules, see PEP-215: https://peps.python.org/pep-0215/. This is the library used by IPython for variable expansion.
